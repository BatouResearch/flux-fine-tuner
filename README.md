# flux-fine-tuner

This is a [Cog](https://cog.run) training model that creates LoRA-based fine-tunes for the [FLUX.1](https://replicate.com/blog/flux-state-of-the-art-image-generation) family of image generation models.

It's live at [replicate.com/ostris/flux-dev-lora-trainer/train](https://replicate.com/ostris/flux-dev-lora-trainer).

## Fine-tuning Flux

If you're just looking to create a fine-tuned Flux model, you don't need to do anything with this codebase.

To get started fine-tuning Flux on Replicate, check out these guides:
